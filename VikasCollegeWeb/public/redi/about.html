                                <p class="about">The motto of our school is “LOYALTY THROUGH SERVICE”. It sums up all the ideals we wish to see mirrored in a Holy Family Student. The value of “loyalty” is displayed through service to God, the nation, fellowmen, the school,
                                    one’s own family and to oneself. The student realises that his life is a God – given gift and he sees a purpose in his life on earth. Hence he makes a conscious effort to discover and develop his talents and abilities
                                    by making the best use of the opportunities that come his way, and uses his abilities for the service of others. As a member of his family, he loves and respects the school family members and contributes his bit for
                                    the welfare of this large family. As a student, he lives up to the noble ideals of the school and does not by any misconduct, bring discredit to himself or to the school. He tries his best to serve his school. As a
                                    citizen of India, he takes pride in his country’s cultural heritage, respects it and works towards the building of a better India of tomorrow. He recognises all men as his brothers and strives towards service when required
                                    especially towards the poor. Most of all, he reflects God’s goodness wherever he goes. </p>
