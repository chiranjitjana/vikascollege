                    <p>
                        The basic aim of education is the development of human potential. Quality education not only becomes a person’s precious asset, but equips him/her to be a responsible and successful citizen. A critical mass of people with higher education and a sense
                        of responsibility is the necessity of any progressive nation. </p>
                    <p>
                        Vidya Vikas Education Society, established in 1962, is constantly dedicated towards the fulfillment of these objectives to impart higher education to the masses; especially the weaker and underprivileged sections of the society and extends support to
                        the helpless. Late Dr. W. S. Matkar, Ex M.L.A, Maharashtra State, Late Dr. Datta Samant, Ex M.P and Trade Unionist and Honorable Shri. P. M. Raut, the present Chairman of the institution, are the founder members of the institution.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Vidya Vikas Education Society is a family which is fortunate to be guided in their mission of education by Shri P. M. Raut, the Chairman, and Smt. Vidya P. Raut, the Chief Executive Officer of institution. Both the pillars of the institution are recipients
                        of the National Award for Teachers in the year 1994 and 2001 respectively from the President of India.
