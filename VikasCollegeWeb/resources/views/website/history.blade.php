                        Education being the basic need of the society, Vidya Vikas Education Society was founded with the goal of providing need- based education to the poor sections of society.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        With only one room on rental basis as the only infrastructure, the first night school was started at Pantnagar, Ghatkopar in 1963. Considering the needs of expansion in 1969, the institution succeeded in getting twelve rooms on rental basis from Maharashtra
                        Housing Board at Kannamwar Nagar, Vikhroli. Beginning with this, facing a number of difficulties, with a great determination and persistent efforts, Vidya Vikas Education Society continued its journey towards progress and there
                        was no looking back.
                    </p>

                        It was in 1974 that after a long process of reclaiming the waste land in Kannamwar Nagar, Vikhroli, the foundation was laid for the present building of the institution. Planted in one room at Pantnagar, Ghatkopar, this tree of Knowledge has grown up with
                        the following 24 branches of education.

                        With an objective of holding light to those in darkness and extending support to helpless and guide those who have lost direction, our kind hearted, socially concerned and dedicated reformers laid down the foundation of Vidya Vikas Education Society in
                        1962, to impart higher education to the masses, especially,the weaker and underprivileged sections of society. Late Dr. W.S. Matkar, Ex. MLA., Maharashtra State, Late Dr. Datta Samant, Renowned Trade Unionist and Ex. MP, Union
                        of India and Shri P.M. Raut, Recipient of the National Award for Teaching and present secretary of the institution are the founder members of the institution. The institution could reach a remarkable milestone in the field of education
